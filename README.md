  # BCI Training: Ghidra Automations and Scripting

</div>

---

This repo contains free training released to the public by the Boston Cybernetics Institute (BCI).

It is companion material for the Ghidra Automations and Scripting video series released on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bostoncybernetics407).

The video series contains three topics: 

<ol> 
  <li> Introduction to the Ghidra API </li>
  <li> Extracting Mnemonic Frequency with Ghidra Scripting </li>
  <li> Writing a Ghidra Python Script to Identify Vulnerable Functions </li>
  </ol> 


## Introduction to the Ghidra API
Watch the instructional video: [Introduction to the Ghidra API](https://youtu.be/XMd_LbcuQ44)
Get the Jupyter notebook and [material](https://github.com/BostonCybernetics-Training/GhidraAutomations/tree/main/Ghidra_API_Introduction)

Are you brand new to the Ghidra API and Ghidra scripting? Or perhaps you find yourself drowning in API documents. Start here to demystify the API and learn what Ghidra scripting is all about.

## Extracting Mnemonic Frequency with Ghidra Scripting
Watch the instructional video [Mnemonic Frequency](https://youtu.be/-IcugoENri8)
Get the Jupyter notebook and [material](https://github.com/BostonCybernetics-Training/GhidraAutomations/tree/main/MnemonicFrequency)

Once you have a basic understanding of the API, you might be asking yourself, "so what?" Check out this material to begin to answer that question. We'll extract the frequency of mnemonics in a binary, then visualize the data using Jupyter and Python.


## Writing a Ghidra Python Script to Identify Vulnerable Functions
Watch the instructional video [Vulnerable Functions](https://youtu.be/_NMxADLzP5Y)
Get the Jupyter notebook and [material](https://github.com/BostonCybernetics-Training/GhidraAutomations/tree/main/PotentiallyVulnerableFunctions)

Finally, we'll learn how to write a Ghidra Python script to idetentify potentially vulnerable functions in a binary. Then, we'll discover how to apply that script to a batch of binaries using Ghidra in headless mode.
